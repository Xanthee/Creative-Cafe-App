# Creative-Web-App

For my Creative Web app, I will be creating a coffee shop app that will be based off of smaller and larger coffee branded web apps such as Starbucks, Costa, Coffee #1 and many more. My app will encourage users to reserve a table under their chosen name and a time they would like to book it for.

On top of this, the user will have some other features to help them out. A map of the cafes location using a Google Maps API that will allow users to see the area and the location its set to while also being able to see the menu if they would like to choose what they want to order in advance.

For the tech stack, I will be using MERN as I believe React will very flexible and efficient with my idea.

The UI for this app will a modern touch on old sophistication bringing coffee lovers and enthusiasts together.

I will use TailwindCSS and vite in my React to help make the UI look more appealing to the user and more efficient.

For the booking database, I will be using MongoDB to store my bookings and user login information.

Ive used cors and MONGODB for my database
